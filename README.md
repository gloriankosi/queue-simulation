- # CS610 Assignment #1 Implementing queue data type
- Implement a queue data type. Then use it to simulate the evolution of waiting queues, by invoking several instances of the queue data type.

- ## Process
- i. We have two classes of service: first class and coach. Each class of service has a dedicated queue.
- ii. There are three service stations for first-class and a single first-class queue.
- iii. There are four coach service stations and a single coach queue.
- iv. Each service station takes passengers from the corresponding queue, but if a first-class service station is free and the queue for the coach is not empty then the
- service station serves passengers from the coach queue.Each service station takes passengers from the corresponding queue,
- but if a first-class service station is free and the queue for the coach is
- not empty then the service station serves passengers from the coach queue.
- v. Passenger arrival times are random, but subject to average arrival times; for example, we get a first-class passenger every
- five minutes and a coach passenger every two minutes on average. Actual arrival times are random.
- vi. Passenger service times are also random, but subject to average service times; for example, first-class passengers usually require
- six minutes of service and coach passengers get on average 2 minutes of service.
- These are average times; actual times vary. All times are measured in minutes.
- vii. The simulation starts with empty waiting queues and free service stations. At some point in time
- (usually 40 minutes prior to departure time) the company closes the queues (no more passengers are admitted);
- then the simulation ends when all the queues are empty and all the service stations are free.

- ## Inputs to the simulation (During runtime)
- i.The duration of the check-in (make it arbitrarily long, do not worry about it being or not being realistic.
- ii.The coach average arrival rate, and average service rate.
- iii.The first-class average arrival rate and average service rate.

- ## Outputs of the Simulation
- i. The duration of the simulation (which may be longer than the input parameter, as when check-in closes,
- there may be passengers in the waiting queues and service stations).
- ii. The maximum length of the queue for each queue.
- iii.The average and maximum waiting time for each queue.
- iv. The rate of occupancy of each service station (percentage of time each station was busy).
- v. If you want: show the real-time evolution of the queues during the run-time simulation.
